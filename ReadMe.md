# Quickstart

## Help

class *PerceptronLearningAlgorithm* - designing, training, testing and cross validating perceptron.


class *dataProcessing* - contains basic methods to process and visualize data.


1. Data Loading
Data can be loaded by input in console or from a text file.

2. Data visualization
2-D dimensional input can be visualized.
Error plots while training can be visualized.

3. Perceptron Learning Algorithm
Training the model using activation and optimization function.
Testing the model by predicting it on the unseen data.
k-fold cross validating to evaluate the model performance.

## To Run
```
python3 perceptron.py
```

### Note: 
Changes can be done to main function: to experiment with input data, to visualize plots, 
									to control training, testing and cross-validation
